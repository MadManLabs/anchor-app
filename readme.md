##What is Anchor?

Anchor is an app built for Windows that layers on top of WampServer package to give you the advantage that Apache HTTP Server's Virtual Hosting provides. It allows you to run custom domains such as `test.dev` (instead of the usual `localhost/test`) on your local development environment with minimal configuration required.

With Anchor sitting on top of WampServer, you can run static HTML and PHP websites easily on the domain name of your choice and still get the performance and features that Apache HTTP Server offers. 

Anchor for Windows is inspired by the beautiful menubar app [Anvil for Mac](http://anvilformac.com/).

##Support for other server configurations

To manage requirements and quickly have a stable Anchor app for release, support for other XAMP configuration other than WampServer is currently not supported. But plans are underway for that.
