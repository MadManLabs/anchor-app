Conceptual Design by Sam-Mauris Yong

##What is Anchor?

Anchor :anchor: is an app built for Windows that layers on top of [WampServer package]() to give you the full fludge advantage that Apache HTTP Server's VirtualHost feature provides. It allows you to run custom domains such as `test.dev` (instead of the usual `localhost/test`) on your local development environment using any local folder with minimal configuration required.

With Anchor sitting on Apache Http Web Server, you can run static HTML and PHP websites easily on the domain name of your choice and still get the performance and features that Apache HTTP Server offers. 

Anchor for Windows is inspired by the beautiful menubar app [Anvil for Mac](http://anvilformac.com/).

##Support for other server configurations

To manage requirements and quickly have a stable Anchor app for release, support for other XAMP configuration other than WampServer is currently not supported. But plans are underway for that.
